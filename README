            'password' => 'foo' 
        );
    
        # Alternatively a config file can be used - generated by initialize_zeo_config.pl
    
        my $zeo = WebService::Zeo->new(config => '/home/user/zeo.conf');
    
        print "Overall Average ZQ Score = " . $zeo->get_overall_average_zq_score() . "\n";

        my @dates = $zeo->get_all_dates_with_sleep_data();
        print "Total recordered dates of sleep data = " , $#dates , "\n";
    
        my @dates_in_range = $zeo->get_dates_with_sleep_data_in_range("2010-12-01","2010-12-04");

DESCRIPTION
    Zeo (http://myzeo.com) is a product and program that measures your
    personal sleep patterns and records key information to help you learn to
    get a better nights sleep. "WebService::Zeo" provides an OO API for
    fetching this sleep data from myzeo.com.

    The following information is required in order to use the API: -
    Username for your myzeo.com account (e.g. username@domain.com) -
    Password for your myzeo.com account - API Key (Can be obtained at
    http://mysleep.myzeo.com/api/api.shtml)

    This module currently supports the JSON REST-based API and uses HTTPS.
    Testing has been performed against server version 1.0.4158 (as of
    1/1/11).
